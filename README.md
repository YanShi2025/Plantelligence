# 🌱 Planter Optimization & Green Agriculture Transformation

**Synergistic Research on Planter Performance Optimization and Green Low-Carbon Agricultural Transformation Under Climate Risk**

This project integrates **precision planting optimization** (APPOM) with **real-time adaptive strategies** (RAPO) to address the dual challenges of climate variability and sustainable food production. Our system intelligently adjusts planting parameters based on environmental data, machine learning models, and green technology principles.
